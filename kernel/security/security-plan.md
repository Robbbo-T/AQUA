# Security Plan
**UTCS-MI Code: [048] Security Plan**

## AQUA OS Security Plan

### Security Objectives
1. **Confidentiality**: Protect sensitive data using post-quantum cryptography
2. **Integrity**: Ensure data integrity through quantum-safe digital signatures
3. **Availability**: Maintain system availability through redundant security measures
4. **Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication with quantum key distribution
5. **Authorization**: Role-based access control with quantum-safe protocols

### Threat Model
- **Classical Threats**: Traditional cyber attacks, malware, insider threats
- **Quantum Threats**: Quantum computer attacks on classical cryptography
- **Aerospace Threats**: RF interference, space environment hazards
- **Supply Chain Threats**: Hardware tampering, software supply chain attacks

### Security Architecture
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers throughout the system
- **Zero Trust**: Never trust, always verify approach
- **Post-Quantum Ready**: All cryptography quantum-safe by default

### Implementation Strategy
- Phase 1: Core security infrastructure
- Phase 2: Platform-specific security
- Phase 3: Domain security integration
- Phase 4: Continuous monitoring and improvement
