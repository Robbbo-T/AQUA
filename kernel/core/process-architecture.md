# Process Architecture
**UTCS-MI Code: [031] Process Architecture**

## Overview

The AQUA OS Process Architecture supports both classical and quantum processes within a unified management framework. The architecture enables hybrid quantum-classical applications while maintaining full compatibility with traditional computing paradigms.

## Process Types

### Classical Processes
- Standard Unix-like processes
- Virtual memory management
- Traditional scheduling algorithms
- Compatible with existing software

### Quantum Processes
- Quantum circuit execution capabilities
- Qubit resource allocation
- Quantum-aware scheduling
- Hybrid classical-quantum operations

### Hybrid Processes
- Processes that can utilize both classical and quantum resources
- Dynamic resource allocation based on workload
- Seamless transition between classical and quantum execution modes

## Process Control Block (PCB) Structure

```c
struct process_control_block {
    // Standard process information
    uint32_t pid;
    uint32_t parent_pid;
    process_state_t state;
    uint32_t flags;
    
    // Memory management
    uint64_t virtual_address_space;
    uint64_t memory_size;
    
    // Quantum resources
    uint32_t allocated_qubits;
    uint32_t quantum_circuit_id;
    
    // Scheduling information
    uint32_t priority;
    uint64_t cpu_time_used;
    uint64_t quantum_time_used;
    
    // Process hierarchy
    struct process_control_block *parent;
    struct process_control_block *children;
    struct process_control_block *siblings;
    struct process_control_block *next;
};
```

## Process States

1. **NEW** - Process being created
2. **READY** - Ready to run on CPU
3. **RUNNING** - Currently executing
4. **WAITING** - Waiting for I/O or resources
5. **QUANTUM_BLOCKED** - Waiting for quantum resources
6. **TERMINATED** - Process has finished execution

## Quantum Resource Management

### Qubit Allocation
- Dynamic qubit allocation based on process requirements
- Qubit pooling for efficient resource utilization
- Quantum error correction integration

### Quantum Circuit Management
- Circuit compilation and optimization
- Circuit caching for repeated operations
- Quantum-classical interface management

## Process Creation and Management

### Classical Process Creation
```c
uint32_t pid = create_process("app_name", entry_point, 0);
```

### Quantum Process Creation
```c
uint32_t pid = create_quantum_process("quantum_app", entry_point, qubit_count);
```

## Security Considerations

- Process isolation using virtual memory
- Quantum resource access control
- Secure inter-process communication
- Post-quantum cryptographic protection

## Performance Characteristics

- Process creation time: < 1ms (classical), < 10ms (quantum)
- Context switch time: < 100Î¼s (classical), < 1ms (quantum)
- Maximum processes: 1024 concurrent
- Quantum processes: Limited by available qubits

## Integration Points

- **Scheduler [051]** - Process scheduling
- **Security Manager [047]** - Access control
- **Quantum Gateway [140]** - Quantum resource access
