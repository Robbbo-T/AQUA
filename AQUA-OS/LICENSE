## GPL v3 Base License

AQUA OS is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPL v3) with additional aerospace-specific clauses for safety-critical usage.

### Base GPL v3 Terms
This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program. If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

## Additional Aerospace Safety Clauses

### Safety-Critical Usage Terms
1. **Certification Responsibility**: Any use of AQUA OS in safety-critical aerospace applications requires proper certification under applicable standards (DO-178C, DO-254, CS-25, etc.).

2. **AMOReS Compliance**: The AMOReS (Aerospace Master Operative Regulating System) framework must remain enabled and properly configured for all safety-critical deployments.

3. **Classical Fallback**: All quantum-enabled safety-critical functions must maintain certified classical fallback implementations.

4. **Audit Requirements**: Safety-critical deployments must maintain complete audit trails and compliance evidence as generated by the AMOReS system.

### Quantum Computing Clauses
1. **Quantum Hardware**: No warranty is provided for quantum hardware compatibility or quantum algorithm performance.

2. **Post-Quantum Security**: Users are responsible for ensuring post-quantum cryptographic implementations meet their security requirements.

3. **Quantum Simulation**: Classical quantum simulation is provided for development only and should not be used for production quantum computations.

### AQUA Axiom Enforcement
1. **Axiom V Compliance**: All usage must comply with AQUA Axiom V - "Enable Life and Consume with Consciousness."

2. **Ethical Usage**: The system's ethics engine and AMOReS governance must not be circumvented or disabled in production deployments.

3. **Conscious Creation**: All system modifications and extensions must align with the conscious creation principle.

## Commercial Use
Commercial use is permitted under GPL v3 terms with the additional requirement that aerospace commercial deployments must:

1. Maintain AMOReS regulatory compliance
2. Provide safety certification evidence
3. Contribute improvements back to the community
4. Support the AQUA Initiative's mission

## Contribution License
By contributing to AQUA OS, contributors agree that their contributions will be licensed under the same terms as this project.

## Third-Party Components
AQUA OS may include third-party components under various licenses. See THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md for details.

## Disclaimer
AQUA OS is experimental software implementing cutting-edge quantum computing and AI technologies. Use in production systems, especially safety-critical aerospace applications, requires thorough testing, validation, and certification.

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
